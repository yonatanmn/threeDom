 *  Matrix Libraries from a Java port of JAMA: A Java Matrix Package, http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/
 *  Developed by Dr Peter Coxhead: http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxc/

 *  I simply removed some irrelevant variables and functions and merge everything into a smaller function. I also added some error checking functions and bug fixing things.
