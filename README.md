# threeDom Kingdom
### 3D engine with DOM elements, no stinky webGL.

Actually it's more like a shipwreck of an engine, but you can take the lead from here

[LIVE DEMO](http://yonatanmn.github.io/threeDom/dist/index.html)
(works with chrome)

**Q:** why would I use divs and other html elements for 3d world, and not webGl with Three.JS ? 

**A:** Mmm.. good question, I have no idea! Maybe just because you can!

### So what can you do 
Download the repository

use it with
```sh
grunt serve
```
and
```sh
grunt build
```

If you want to have fun with dom3D, try to understand what I've done, and continue developing this cool engine.

If you just want to have fun - playaround, the api is not that complicated, hopefully someday you'll build your kingDOM and live happily ever after.
